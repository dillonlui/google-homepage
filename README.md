# google-homepage

This is a project designed to create a duplicate of the Google homepage to demonstrate familiarity with HTML, CSS, and GitHub.

After finishing this project, I realize how difficult web development is. It took me an extremely long time to build such a simple website, the code looks relatively simple, yet I couldn't get the elements placed where I needed them to be. I went through the process of searching online (thanks real Google and Stackoverflow), and using Chrome's devtools to inspect other pages and debug my own. My main takeaway is that the syntax matters, those small details can break the site and leave you extremely frustrated.
